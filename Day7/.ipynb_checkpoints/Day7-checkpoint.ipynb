    "The aim of this workshop is to introduce you the application of **natural language processing (NLP)** algorithms to study free text data. NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on trying to understand written and spoken text. In this workshop, we will focus specifically on **topic modelling**, which is an unsupervised machine learning method that automatically analyses groups of words to identify clusters of words that belong to the same topic, or theme.\n",

    "In particular, we will use topic. modelling to try to understand the reasons behind the change in drug use patterns of recreational drug users during the early stages of the pandemic. In the morning, we will investigate why recreational drug users decided to increase their use, later in the day you will apply what you learnt in this stage of the workshop to understand why they decided to decrease their drug use.\n"
