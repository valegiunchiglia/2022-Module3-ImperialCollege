# Introduction to Computational Methods for the Brain Sciences

**Module 3 from the MSc in Translational Neuroscience** will introduce you to the most relevant computational methods for the Brain Sciences. It will be divided into 8 days, where each day handles a different thematic and methodology. Each day will consist of workshops and lectures, that start in the morning and end at 5pm. 
      
      Apart from day 1, all the other days will be characterised by a final EXERCISE. 
      At the end of the first week, you will be randomly assigned one of these exercises, 
      which you have to complete and present in a report, that will be assessed. 
      In the afternoon of each day, you will have the opportunity to start working on 
      these exercises, and ask questions to the TAs in case you have any doubts or problems. 

The general format of each day will be the following: 

1. **Morning**:
    * Introductory lecture 
    * Guided workshop
2. **Afternoon**:
    * Start of potentially assessed exercise (with help of TAs)

The schedule of the Module is presented in the following table.
